# pygoogledrive
Upload data to Google Drive

## Quick Start 
Follow all steps under https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python to enable Gmail API, generate and download secret file. Create "secret" folder in the root of the project. Move google secret file to secret/drive_client_secret.json. Finally run ```python pygoogledrive.py```. Should you get security error, try running it with sudo access, ```sudo python pygoogledrive.py```. The first time you run the script you will be asked to open google url and approve access to google drive. The token generated by google drive will be stored permanently under ```secret/drive_client_credentials.json```. Read more about tokens under google drive documentations.

## Constants
```pygoogledrive.py``` executes ```loop()``` to poll ```path = '/tmp/'``` folder every ```sleep_time = 60``` seconds.
If files are present, zip, upload, delete. Files are zipped with timestamp as a file name.
